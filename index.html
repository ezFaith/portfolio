        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Dipankar Saha, a postgraduate student currently pursuing an MSc in IT Cybersecurity. As someone deeply interested in the field of information security, I am eager to learn how to protect systems and data from ever-evolving cyber threats. My academic journey focuses on building a strong foundation in areas such as network security, cryptography, and ethical hacking. Though I’m at the beginning of my career, I am enthusiastic about exploring new technologies, developing problem-solving skills, and contributing to a safer digital world. I'm always excited to learn, grow, and tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges. When I’m not studying, you’ll often find me "exploring tech blogs," "experimenting with new software tools," "playing football," or "participating in coding challenges".</p>
